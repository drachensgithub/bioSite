            <h2>The Best Mom: Nicole Dale</h2>
            <p>
            My mom is one of those people who wants to help everyone, but also is weary of the people she helps.
            She loves her family and her job, but also makes time for herself. She is a very empowering person and will strive to continue her education whether that be school,
            people, or just the world in general. She understands the importance of everything, but also knows that if you continue to push forward you will find ways to navigate 
            your way through this crazy world we know. She is a kind and gentle soul, but if you wrong her you will definitely know it. 
            She loves to watch movies as I do, even though I might make her watch some crazy stuff sometimes! She loves very hard, but is also someone who will forgive but never forget. 
            Her favorite movie changes from being Pride and Prejudice or Practical Magic depending on which day you ask her. 
            She loves watching TV and will give anything a try. She is a gardener, but more importantly she loves to cook, and boy does she do it well. 
            Overall, my mom, or Nicole Dale as you know her, is the best person I know and has helped me throughout my life in more ways than I can count. 
            I love her a lot and I know she loves me just as much. I can not wait to learn more about her as my life goes on.
